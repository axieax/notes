**A large group of children has assembled to play a modified version of hop-scotch. The squares appear in a line, numbered from $0$ to $n$, and a child is successful if they start at square $0$ and make a sequence of jumps to reach square $n$. However, each child can only jump at most $k \lt n$ squares at a time, i.e., from square $i$ they can reach squares $i+1,i+2,...,i+k$ but not $i+k+1$, and a child cannot clear the entire game in one jump. An additional rule of the game specifies an array $A[1,...,n-1]$, where $A[i]$ is the maximum number of children who can jump on square $i$​. Assuming the children cooperate, what is the largest number of children who can successfully complete the game?**

The modified hop-scotch game can be modelled with a flow network, using squares as vertices, and an edge $e(i,j)$ between two vertices if it is possible to make an immediate jump from square $i$ to square $j$ (there are $O(n(n-1))=O(n^2)$ such edges). Since children can make a sequence of jumps from square $0$ to square $n$, set these two vertices as the source and sink respectively. For the remaining $n$ vertices $v$ which correspond to squares $1$ to $n-1$, the capacity of vertex $v$ can be represented by two vertices $v_{in}$ and $v_{out}$ with a connecting edge from $v_{in}$ to $v_{out}$ having the capacity of the original vertex $v$, which is $A[v]$ units. The other edges (between different vertices) should have an arbitrarily large capacity of $\infty$ so the vertex capacities become flow bottlenecks for augmented paths. The maximum flow of this network represents the largest number of children who can successfully complete the game, i.e. make a sequence of jumps from square $0$ to square $n$​​. The Edmonds-Karp algorithm can be used to find the maximum flow of the network in $O(|V||E|^2) = O(n\cdot (n^2)^2) = O(n^5)$​​ time.
