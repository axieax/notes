**You have $n$ warehouses and $n$ shops. At each warehouse, a truck is loaded with enough goods to supply one shop. There are $m$ roads, each going from a warehouse to a shop, and driving along the $i$th road takes $d_i$ hours, where $d_i$​ is an integer. Design a polynomial time algorithm to send the trucks to the shops, minimising the time until all shops are supplied.**

Since roads go from $n$​​​ warehouses to $n$​​​ shops, this relationship can be modelled using a directed bipartite graph, with edges representing $m$​​​ roads going from the set of warehouse vertices to the set of shop vertices. We can extend this graph as a flow network, defining a super source node with outgoing edges connected to all warehouses (sources), as well as a super sink node with incoming edges connected from all shops (sinks). Setting the capacity of all incoming edges to the super sink to be 1 unit, we can check that all shops have been supplied if the maximum flow from the network is $n$​​​ units. Since all integers $d_i$​​​ are positive integers, this capacity of 1 unit becomes a bottleneck for all augmented paths in the network, so we can similarly set all edges to have a capacity of 1 unit. The Ford-Fulkerson method can be used to find the maximum flow in the network in $O(|E|\cdot f_{max})$​​​ worst case time, where $f_{max}$​​​ is the maximum possible flow of the network, and can be simplified to $O((2n+m) \cdot n) = O(n^2 + nm)$​​​ time. Assuming all trucks leave the warehouses at the same time, minimising the time until all shops are supplied is equivalent to minimising the longest drive time $d_i$​​​. We can sort $d_i$​​​ such that it forms an increasing sequence using merge sort in $O(m\log m)$​​​ time, and use binary search to select an upper bound $d_i$​​​ for the roads to be included in the flow network, in $O(\log m)$​​​ time. With a fixed upper bound $d_i$​​​ selected using binary search, the maximum flow subproblem can be run on a flow network which only includes roads that do not take longer than $d_i$​​​ hours to drive along. This step has a running time of $O((n^2+nm)\log m)$​​​. The solution to the problem is thus the smallest $d_i$​​​ which has a maximum flow of $n$​​​ units for its subproblem, indicating that all shops can be supplied with roads that take $\leq d_i$​​​ hours to drive along. This algorithm has a final worst-case time complexity of $O(m\log m + (n^2+nm)\log m) = O((n^2+nm)\log m)$​​​.
