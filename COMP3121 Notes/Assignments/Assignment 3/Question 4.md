**You are on vacation for $N$​​​ days at a resort that has three possible activities 1, 2 and 3. For each day $i$​​​​​, for each activity 1, 2 or 3, you've determined how much enjoyment $e(i,j) \gt 0, (1 \leq i \leq n, 1 \leq j \leq 3)$​​​​ you will get out of that activity if you do it on that particular day (the same activity might give you a different amounts of enjoyment at different days). However, you are not allowed to do the same activity two days in a row. Design an algorithm for determining the maximum total enjoyment possible over the stay of $N$​ days and the sequence of activities you should do at each day.**

Going backwards, note max and selected activity
