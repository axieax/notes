Dynamic Programming Criteria:

- Subproblem
- Base cases
- Recursion
- How to obtain the final solution
- Time complexity

Algorithms can be treated as a "blackbox"

Exam:

- 1 Divide / Conquer
- 1 Greedy
- 2 DP
- 1 Max-flow

Possible linear programming - need to recognise one and convert one to standard case
